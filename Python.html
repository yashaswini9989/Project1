    <h1><center>Python</center></h1>
    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability, simplicity, 
        and broad versatility across many fields—from web development to artificial intelligence and automation. 
        It emphasizes clean, readable code and supports multiple programming paradigms, 
        making it accessible to both beginners and professionals.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Key Features of Python:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy to Learn and Read:</strong> Python uses clear, readable syntax with indentation to define code blocks, 
        eliminating the need for braces and making code approachable for all experience levels.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dynamically Typed:</strong>Variable types are determined at runtime, 
        meaning there's no need for explicit type declarations, which accelerates development.</li>

        <li><strong>Interpreter-Based:</strong>ython code runs line by line through an interpreter,
         making debugging and testing easier and more interactive for developers.</li>

        <li><strong>Free and Open Source:</strong>Python’s source code is freely available and can be modified and redistributed by anyone,
         fostering a vast, active community.</li>

        <li><strong>GUI and Web Capabilities:</strong>Supports GUI development (with libraries like Tkinter, PyQt) 
        and web frameworks (like Django and Flask) for building interfaces and applications.</li>
    </ul>

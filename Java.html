    <h1><center>JAVA</center></h1>

    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed for portability, 
    security, and robust application development across multiple platforms. 
    It follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning compiled Java code (bytecode)
     can run on any device equipped with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
    regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.</p>

    <h3><strong>Key Features of Java</strong></h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong>Java is fully object-oriented, supporting classes,
         objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, 
        and abstraction, which promote reusable and modular code design.</li>

        <li><strong>Platform Independent:</strong>Java code is compiled into bytecode, 
        which is interpreted by JVMs on
         various platforms, enabling cross-platform compatibility.</li>

        <li><strong>Simple and Easy to Learn: </strong>Java simplifies programming by removing complex
         features like pointers and multiple inheritance,
         and it provides strong memory management with automatic garbage collection</li>

        <li><strong>High Performance:</strong>The use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers and optimized runtime environments
         makes Java faster than traditional interpreted languages.</li>

        <li><strong>Distributed:</strong>Java is designed to support distributed computing with features like Remote Method Invocation
         (RMI) and networking capabilities built into the language.</li>
    </ul>

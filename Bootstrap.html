    <h1><center>BootStrap</center></h1>
    <p>Bootstrap is a widely used open-source front-end framework that streamlines the development of responsive, 
    mobile-first websites by providing a rich library of pre-designed CSS and JavaScript components. It is well-known for its efficiency, 
    consistent results across different browsers, 
    and a flexible grid system that makes adaptive web design easy.</p>

    <h3>What Is Bootstrap?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bootstrap provides a comprehensive suite of UI components like navigation bars, 
        buttons, forms, modals, alerts, and cards,
         all designed to be instantly usable and easy to customize</li>
        <li>Its foundation is a responsive 12-column grid system powered by Flexbox that allows layouts to adjust seamlessly across mobile,
         tablet, and desktop devices.</li>
        
        <li>Bootstrap includes built-in JavaScript plugins to add features such as modals, carousels, dropdowns,
         and tooltips without the need for custom scripting.</li>
    </ul>

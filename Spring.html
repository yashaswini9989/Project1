    <h1><center>Spring</center></h1>
    <p>Spring is a powerful, open-source framework for building scalable, 
    maintainable, and secure enterprise-level Java applications. Its modular architecture,
    core features, and large ecosystem have made it one of the most widely adopted solutions 
    for modern software development.</p>

    <h3>Core Concepts and Features</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC):</strong>Spring’s IoC container manages object creation and dependency wiring, allowing loose coupling,
         modular code, and easier testing. DI can be achieved via constructors, setters, or fields.</li>

        <li><strong>Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):</strong> Spring lets developers separate
        cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, transactions) from business logic, improving
        code clarity and maintainability.</li>

        <li><strong>Transaction Management: </strong>Provides a unified model for handling transactions across databases and messaging systems,
        supporting both declarative and programmatic transactions.</li>

        <li><strong>Modularity:</strong>Spring’s architecture is divided into modules—developers can use only the
        required components, making projects lightweight and flexible.</li>

        <li><strong>Spring MVC:</strong>A robust framework for building web applications using
        the Model-View-Controller pattern, enabling clear separation between business logic, 
        user interface, and application flow.</li>
    </ul>

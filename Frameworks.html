    <h1><center>Frameworks </center></h1>
    <p>Frameworks are structured collections of pre-written code, tools, 
    and best practices that streamline software development by providing reusable 
    components and guiding architecture. In modern development, frameworks significantly 
    accelerate the creation of web, mobile, and desktop applications by solving common problems 
    and enforcing consistency.</p>

    <h3><strong>What Are Frameworks?</strong></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>A framework offers a foundation—skeleton code, libraries, design patterns, and conventions—so developers 
        can focus on building specific functionality instead of reinventing basic structures.</li>

        <li>Frameworks can be domain-specific (e.g., web, mobile, data science) 
        or general-purpose, supporting many types of projects</li>
    </ul>

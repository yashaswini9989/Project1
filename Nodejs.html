    <h1><center>Node.js</center></h1>

    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows
    developers to execute JavaScript code outside the browser, primarily for server-side and network application development. Built on Googleâ€™s high-performance V8 JavaScript engine,
    Node.js delivers exceptional speed and scalability for real-time, data-intensive web applications.</p>

    <h3><strong>Key Features</strong></h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>JavaScript on the Server:</strong>Node.js makes it possible to use a single programming language (JavaScript) for both front-end and server-side development,
    simplifying project workflows and enabling code reuse.</li>

    <li><strong>Asynchronous, Non-blocking I/O:</strong>Uses an event-driven architecture,
    enabling Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently without waiting for any operation to finish,
    making it ideal for chat apps, gaming servers, and streaming platforms.</li>

    <li><strong>Single-threaded Event Loop:</strong>Operates on a single thread
    that efficiently manages thousands of concurrent connections through the
    event loop and callbacks, minimizing resource consumption.</li>

    <li><strong>V8 Engine Performance:</strong>ode.js leverages the V8 engine to compile JavaScript into native machine code,
    ensuring fast execution and enhanced performance for complex applications.</li>

    <li><strong>Rich NPM Ecosystem:</strong>Includes Node Package Manager (NPM), a vast repository of modules and libraries that accelerate
    development and simplify dependency management.</li>



    </ul>

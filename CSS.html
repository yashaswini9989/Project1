    <h1><center>CSS</center></h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. 
        It controls how web pages look, 
        including layout, colors, fonts, and animations. Think of it this way:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is the skeleton and content of the webpage (headings, paragraphs, images).</li>
        <li>CSS is the clothing and style (making those headings red, arranging paragraphs in columns, adding background images).
        </li>

    </ul>    
    <h4>Key Points</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><q>Cascading</q>means styles from different sources (external, internal, inline) follow priority rules; more specific styles and those marked !important take precedence</li>
        <li>CSS allows for responsive web design, adapting layouts and styles to various screens (desktop, tablet, mobile).</li>
        <li>CSS modules (Color, Layout, Animations, etc.) are standardized by the W3C and evolve individually for new features.</li>
    </ul>
